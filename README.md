# Graph Nexus for LLM

A code intelligence graph I built for working with LLMs and AI agents. Indexes any codebase across 14 languages in milliseconds, then answers structural questions like *who calls this*, *what's the blast radius if I change this function*, or *what's related to the auth flow*.

Built on top of [GitNexus](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari/GitNexus) by [Abhigyan Patwari](https://github.com/abhigyanpatwari) — same core idea (structural knowledge graph of a repo), rewritten in Rust for speed. Licensed under [PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0](./LICENSE).

Under the hood: zero-copy on-disk storage (rkyv + mmap), hybrid search (BM25 via Tantivy + BGE-M3 dense vectors), framework-aware route extraction. The CLI is `gnx`.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Blazing Fast & Zero-Copy**: Uses Tree-sitter + Rayon multi-threading for parsing, and `rkyv` for zero-copy memory-mapped `graph.bin` retrieval. It processes large repos in milliseconds.
*   **14 Languages Supported**: C, C#, C++, Dart, Go, Java, JavaScript, Kotlin, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Swift, TypeScript.
*   **LLM-Native Output**: Emits extreme token-efficient formats ([TOON](https://crates.io/crates/etoon)) and concise string summaries. No hallucination-inducing formatting.
*   **Hybrid Search Engine**:
    *   **Semantic Search**: Uses **BGE-M3 INT8 Quantized Model** via `fastembed-rs` (`--embeddings`). Cross-lingual concept matching (e.g., search "Session Management" in Chinese, find English functions) with AVX2 CPU acceleration and massive memory reduction.
    *   **Lexical Search**: Uses **Tantivy (BM25)** for zero-latency, full-text tokenized keyword matching.
*   **Incremental Caching**: Only re-computes ASTs and Embeddings for modified files (SHA-256 Content Hash). Graph rebuilds drop from ~50s (Cold Start) to **< 0.25s**!
*   **Zero-Maintenance Route Extraction**: Purely based on RFC 7231 HTTP constants. Extracts API routes from both Declarative (e.g., `@Get`) and Imperative (e.g., `app.get()`) definitions across all languages.
*   **RAG Document Indexing**: Securely isolates `.md` (Markdown) and `.yaml` (GitHub Actions) files into parallel structures, parsing sections natively for LLM documentation retrieval without polluting the code execution graph.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/coseto6125/graph-nexus --bin gnx
```

After install, the binary is named `gnx` (the package on crates.io is `graph-nexus`).

## ⚡ Usage

```bash
# 1. Build a code graph for the current repo (Extremely fast, < 1s)
gnx analyze --repo .

# 2. Build with BGE-M3 Semantic Embeddings (Downloads ~540MB INT8 model on first run)
gnx analyze --repo . --embeddings

# 3. Hybrid Search: Semantic Concept (Requires --embeddings)
gnx query --query "authentication flow"

# 4. Hybrid Search: Exact Keyword BM25 (Uses Tantivy)
gnx query --query "loginUser"

# 5. Extract all API Routes across the Microservice
gnx route-map --repo .

# 6. Find a symbol's blast-radius / execution flow
gnx impact --target validateUser --direction upstream

# 7. Explore Context (Metadata, Decorators, Signatures)
gnx context --name validateUser
```

All commands accept `--format text|json|toon`. The default for query is a highly token-optimized text format.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
crates/
├── graph-nexus-core        # Zero-copy graph (rkyv), Incremental Caching, Graph Queries
├── graph-nexus-analyzer    # Tree-sitter parsers, BGE-M3 Embedder, HTTP Route Detector
└── graph-nexus-cli         # `gnx` binary, Tantivy BM25 Engine, Token-optimized Output
```

The analyzer streams parsed nodes through an MPSC channel into a single builder thread that assembles the graph, applies Route & Document extraction rules, and writes a zero-copy `.gitnexus-rs/graph.bin`. Read operations (like `context` and `query`) memory-map this file directly for zero-latency lookups.
